If running Ecodist, choose at the first GUI the option 'Just Geometry'. Confirm it. 

Then you select Input_lab.txt, Input_rock.txt and ME1_Labordaten...txt. These files must be stored in the working folder. Confirm it.

At the next step choose 'Surface scan as xyz point cloud'. Confirm it.

Choose the grid constant and select ME1SideA.xyz as point cloud. Confirm it.

Now the programme should create a folder with the current date as name and the input and the output will be stored in it.

!Notice!: The gird constant can cause long calculation times. In the given example the calculation on a standard PC varies from 7 seconds (for a=5 mm) to 35 minutes (for a=0.5 mm).
